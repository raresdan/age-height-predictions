# ðŸ“ˆAge vs Height predicitor

This project is a simple web application built using Flask, incorporating a Linear Model developed with Scikit-learn to estimate the height of teenagers based on their age. The application provides an interactive plotting feature using Plotly, allowing users to input a specific age and visualize the corresponding height estimation made by the model.

## Features

- **Flask Web Application:** Utilizes Flask to create a user-friendly web interface.
- **Linear Model:** Implements a Linear Model using Scikit-learn, trained on a dataset in pickel format, containing age and height data of teenagers. Saved & Loaded the model using Joblib.
- **Interactive Plotting:** Incorporates Plotly to generate interactive plots, enabling users to input age parameters and visualize height estimations in real-time.
- **User-friendly Interface:** Offers a seamless user experience with intuitive controls for age input and dynamic visualization of height estimations.
